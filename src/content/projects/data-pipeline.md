# Real-time Data Pipeline

An end-to-end data processing pipeline designed for handling high-volume streaming data from IoT sensors and devices.

## Architecture

- Data ingestion with Apache Kafka
- Stream processing with Apache Spark
- Time-series storage with InfluxDB
- Visualization with Grafana
- Container orchestration with Docker Compose

## Key Components

- **Producers**: IoT device simulators
- **Consumers**: Data processors and aggregators
- **Storage**: Optimized for time-series data
- **Monitoring**: Real-time dashboards and alerts

## Performance Metrics

- Processes 10,000+ events per second
- Sub-second latency
- 99.9% uptime
- Scalable to millions of devices
